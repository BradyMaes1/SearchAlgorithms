# Search Algorithms Project 1

Name: Brady Maes
Project: Program 1: Search Methods
Description: In this project, I will test and compare 5 different search algorithms for pathfinding through a small list of physical locations.
Search Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Depth-First search (ID-DFS), Best-First search, and A* search (pronounced A star)
